				Baylor Schedule Planner
################################################################################

The goal of this program is to create every possible schedule that a student could 
register for, given various parameters. This program automates creating and 
registering for optimal class schedules instead of manually going through every 
combination of classes in BearWeb.


USER GUIDE:

Before editing anything, make sure "Main.exe", "UserInput.txt" and 
"UserInputInstructions.txt" are all stored within the same folder on your desktop.

To use the program, first read "UserInputInstructions.txt", then edit "UserInput.txt",
where you will edit fields such as classes, professors, etc. Once you have filled
out all fields in "UserInput.txt", run "Main.exe", which will generate an Excel
spreadsheet or txt file(depending on your input) with every possible schedule within 
the user's criteria. The txt and/or Excel spreadsheet will be stored within the same
folder as "Main.exe".

When you try to run "Main.exe", Windows might warn you that it is a virus. Simply
click the "More info" button, then "Run anyway" to bypass this. Enjoy!
