				Baylor Schedule Planner
################################################################################

The goal of this program is to create every possible schedule that a student could 
register for, given various parameters. This program automates creating and 
registering for optimal class schedules instead of manually going through every 
combination of classes in BearWeb.


USER GUIDE:

To use the program, first read "UserInputInstructions.txt", then edit "UserInput.txt",
where you will edit fields such as classes, professors, etc. Once you have filled
out all fields in "UserInput.txt", run "Main.exe", which will generate an Excel
spreadsheet with every possible schedule within the user's criteria.

When you try to run "Main.exe", Windows might warn you that it is a virus. Simply
click the "More info" button, then "Run anyway" to bypass this. Enjoy!
