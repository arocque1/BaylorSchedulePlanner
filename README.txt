The goal of this program is to create every possible schedule that a student could 
register for, given various parameters. This program automates creating and 
registering for optimal class schedules instead of manually going through every 
combination of classes in BearWeb.


USER GUIDE:

"UserInput.txt" and "UserInputInstructions.txt" are all stored within the 
same folder on your desktop.

where you will edit the given fields. Once you have filled out all fields in 
"UserInput.txt", run "BaylorSchedulePlanner.exe" or "Main.py", and it will 
generate an Excel spreadsheet or txt file(depending on your input) with 
every possible schedule within the user's criteria. The txt and/or Excel 
spreadsheet will be stored within the same folder that "BaylorSchedulePlanner.exe" 
or "Main.py" is stored in.
